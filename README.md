Packaged Lightweight Environments As Sandboxed Executions. 

A modern package manager for macOS that leverages Apple's native OCI container
support to run CLI tools in isolated Linux environments. Each tool runs in its
own container, eliminating dependency conflicts while providing:

			  • Multiple versions side-by-side
			  • Reproducible development environments
			  • Zero system pollution
			  • Automatic version switching per project

Install tools from curated container images and switch between versions
seamlessly without affecting your system installation.
